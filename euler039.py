If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c},
there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

'''

''' notes

a + b + c = p

sqrt(a^2 + b ^2) = c

a + b + sqrt(a^2 + b ^2)  = p
